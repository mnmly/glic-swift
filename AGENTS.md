        ## Repository Role

        - Name: `glic-cpp`
        - Role: `repo`
        - Original source path: `GLIC/implementation/glic-cpp`
- Public surface: website/

        ## Working Rules

        - This root is the canonical git root for this repository.
        - Nested repositories must stay as submodules, never as raw nested `.git` directories.
        - Do not merge sibling repositories back into this tree.
        - Preserve generated bilingual documentation unless you are intentionally updating it.

        ## Important Paths

        - `README.md` is the human-facing overview.
        - `FILE-STRUCTURE.md` documents the normalized layout.
        - Public materials live in `website/`, `webpage/`, `ui/`, or root `index.html`.

        ## Submodules

        - `external/stb`

        ## Safe Changes

        - Update `.gitignore` by appending to the generated block when needed.
        - Keep vendor dependencies isolated as submodules.
        - Prefer small, repo-local commits.
